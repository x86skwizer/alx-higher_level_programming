# 0x0B-python-input_output

This repository contains solutions to the exercises and projects for the **0x0B-python-input_output** curriculum, which is part of the larger **ALX School** Full-Stack Software Engineering program.

## Description

In this curriculum, we explore the concepts of **input** and **output** in Python. Input and output operations are essential for interacting with users, reading data from files, and writing data to files. Understanding how to handle input and output effectively is crucial for building robust and interactive applications.

The curriculum covers the following topics:

- Reading and writing text files
- Handling file permissions and exceptions
- Serializing and deserializing Python objects using JSON
- Working with CSV files
- Reading and writing binary files
- Using the `with` statement for file handling
- Standard input and output streams

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific topic or exercise. Here is an overview of the directory structure:

- `0-read_file`: Reading the contents of a text file and printing them to the standard output.
- `1-number_of_lines`: Counting the number of lines in a text file.
- `2-read_lines`: Reading and printing specific lines from a text file.
- `3-write_file`: Writing a string to a text file.
- `4-append_write`: Appending a string to the end of a text file.
- `5-to_json_string`: Converting a Python object to a JSON string.
- `6-from_json_string`: Converting a JSON string to a Python object.
- `7-save_to_json_file`: Saving a Python object to a JSON file.

- `11-student`: Creating a Python class and implementing methods for serialization and deserialization.
- `12-pascal_triangle`: Generating Pascal's Triangle and writing it to a text file.
- `13-student`: Extending the `Student` class from a previous exercise with additional functionality.
- `100-append_after`: Inserting a line of text after each occurrence of a specific string in a text file.
- `101-stats`: Parsing a log file and calculating various statistics.
