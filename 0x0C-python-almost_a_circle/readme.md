# 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle

This repository contains solutions to the exercises and projects for the **0x0C-python-almost_a_circle** curriculum, which is part of the larger **Holberton School** Full-Stack Software Engineering program.

## Description

In this curriculum, we work on building a robust and comprehensive set of classes to represent geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and squares. We implement various functionalities such as calculating area, perimeter, and displaying the shapes. Additionally, we explore concepts such as serialization and deserialization of objects using JSON, and unit testing using the `unittest` module.

The curriculum covers the following topics:

- Base class implementation
- Class inheritance
- Getter and setter methods
- Class serialization and deserialization using JSON
- Unit testing using the `unittest` module

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific topic or exercise. Here is an overview of the directory structure:

- `models`: Contains the implementation of the classes representing rectangles and squares.
- `tests`: Contains the unit tests for the classes implemented in the `models` directory.
