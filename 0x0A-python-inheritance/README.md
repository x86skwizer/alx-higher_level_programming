# 0x0A-python-inheritance

This repository contains solutions to the exercises and projects for the **0x0A-python-inheritance** curriculum, which is part of the **ALX Program** Full-Stack Software Engineering track.

## Description

In this curriculum, we explore the concept of **inheritance** in Python. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows us to create new classes based on existing classes. It enables code reuse, modularity, and polymorphism.

The curriculum covers the following topics:

- Introduction to inheritance
- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Overriding methods
- Base class and subclass relationships
- Inheritance and composition
- Polymorphism

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific topic or exercise. Here is an overview of the directory structure:

- `0-lookup`: Introduction to the `dir()` function and how to use it to get a list of available attributes and methods of an object.
- `1-my_list`: Creating a class that inherits from the built-in `list` class and adds additional functionality.
- `2-is_same_class`: Implementing a function that checks if an object is an instance of a given class.
- `3-is_kind_of_class`: Implementing a function that checks if an object is an instance of a class or a class that inherited from a specific class.
- `4-inherits_from`: Implementing a function that checks if an object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from a specific class.
- `5-base_geometry`: Creating an empty class as a base for future geometry classes.
- `6-base_geometry`: Adding functionality to the `BaseGeometry` class by implementing a method to calculate the area.
- `7-base_geometry`: Adding additional functionality to the `BaseGeometry` class by implementing a method to validate the value of a parameter.
- `8-rectangle`: Creating a class that inherits from `BaseGeometry` and represents a rectangle.
- `9-rectangle`: Adding additional functionality to the `Rectangle` class by implementing a method to calculate the area.
- `10-square`: Creating a class that inherits from `Rectangle` and represents a square.
- `11-square`: Adding additional functionality to the `Square` class by implementing a method to calculate the area.
- `100-my_int`: Creating a class that inherits from `int` and changes the behavior of the `==` and `!=` operators.
- `101-add_attribute`: Implementing a function that adds a new attribute to an object if possible.
