## Introduction

In this project, you will find various Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of classes. Each script focuses on a specific concept or feature related to classes. By exploring these scripts, you will gain a solid understanding of how classes work in Python and how to leverage them to write efficient and organized code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 0x06-python-classes project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/x86skwizer/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x06-python-classes" project directory:

   ```
   cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x06-python-classes
   ```

3. Choose a script that you want to explore and open it in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

## Usage

Each script in the "0x06-python-classes" project has its own usage instructions. Before running a script, make sure to read the comments and docstrings within the code to understand its purpose and how to use it effectively.

To run a script, use the following command:

```
python3 script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the script you want to run.
