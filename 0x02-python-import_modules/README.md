## Description

The **0x02-python-import_modules** project introduces the concept of importing and using modules in Python. Modules are files containing Python code that define functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other Python programs. This project provides hands-on experience in working with modules, understanding their syntax, and utilizing them effectively in Python programs.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `0-add.py`: A Python script that imports a function from another module and uses it to perform addition.
- `1-calculation.py`: A Python script that imports multiple functions from another module and uses them to perform various calculations.
- `2-args.py`: A Python script that imports a function from another module and uses it to print the command-line arguments passed to the script.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: A Python script that imports a function from another module and uses it to perform addition on an arbitrary number of command-line arguments.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: A Python script that prints all the names defined by a module, excluding those that start with `__`.
- `5-variable_load.py`: A Python script that imports a variable from another module and prints its value.

## Requirements

To run the files in this project, you need:

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/x86skwizer/0x02-python-import_modules.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd 0x02-python-import_modules
   ```

3. Run the Python scripts using the following command:

   ```
   python3 script_name.py
   ```

   Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run.
