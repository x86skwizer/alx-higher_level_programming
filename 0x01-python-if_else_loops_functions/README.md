## Description

The 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions project is a collection of Python scripts that cover various topics related to conditional statements, loops, and functions. Each script is designed to help you practice and reinforce your understanding of these concepts.

The project is divided into multiple directories, each containing scripts related to a specific topic. The directories are organized as follows:

- `0-positive_or_negative`: Contains scripts that determine whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit`: Contains scripts that extract and manipulate the last digit of a given number.
- `2-print_alphabet`: Contains scripts that print the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabt`: Contains scripts that print the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- `4-print_hexa`: Contains scripts that print numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal formats.
- `5-print_comb2`: Contains scripts that print all possible combinations of two digits.
- `6-print_comb3`: Contains scripts that print all possible combinations of three digits.
- `7-islower`: Contains scripts that check if a given character is a lowercase letter.
- `8-uppercase`: Contains scripts that convert a string to uppercase.
- `9-print_last_digit`: Contains scripts that print the last digit of a given number.
- `10-add`: Contains scripts that perform addition of two numbers.
- `11-pow`: Contains scripts that calculate the power of a number.
- `12-fizzbuzz`: Contains scripts that implement the FizzBuzz game.
- `13-insert_number`: Contains scripts that insert a number into a sorted singly linked list.

Feel free to explore each directory and work on the scripts at your own pace. Each script contains instructions and comments to guide you through the implementation.

## Requirements

To run the scripts in this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The scripts are compatible with Python 3.x versions.

## Usage

To run a specific script from the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the "alx-higher_level_programming" repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/x86skwizer/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions" project directory:

   ```
   cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
   ```

3. Choose a directory and navigate to it:

   ```
   cd directory-name
   ```

4. Run the desired script using the following command:

   ```
   python3 script-name.py
   ```

   The script will execute and display the output based on its functionality.
